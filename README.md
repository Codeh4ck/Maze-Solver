# Maze-Solver
A project demonstrating the solution of maze matrixes using the Breadth-first search algorithm.

# Desclaimer
This project has been written fully by me, **Nikolas Andreou** (*Delirium*), a Greek C# programmer. The reason I wrote this example is for a programming challenge for the **Alliance for Digital Employability 1st Coding Bootcamp of Athens** and **e-Travel** company. If you have any questions, feedback, suggestions, bug report, feel free to create an issue or even contact me at deliriumghs@hotmail.gr

Happy maze solving and learning!
